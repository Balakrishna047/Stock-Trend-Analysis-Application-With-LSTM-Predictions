Stock trend analysis application with LSTM predictions
* Preprocessed and cleaned historical stock data, incorporating feature engineering
techniquies.
* Developed LSTM models using TensorFlow/Keras to capture temporal dependencies and
make future stock predictions.
* Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and
achieved a prediction accuracy of [accuracy metric] %.
* Visualised model predictions and trends using Power BI.
