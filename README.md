LSTM ALGORITHM

Algorithm for Stock Trend Analysis using LSTM Predictions
* Step 1: Data Collection
* Gather historical stock price data from reliable sources like financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) or databases.
* Step 2: Data Preprocessing
* Clean the data by handling missing values, adjusting for stock splits or dividends, and converting raw data into a suitable format for modeling.
* Normalize or scale the data to ensure uniformity across different features.
* Step 3: Data Splitting
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Typically, use around 70-80% of the data for training and the remaining for testing/validation.
* Step 4: Feature Engineering
* Extract relevant features from the dataset. Common features include stock prices, volume, moving averages, technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD), and sentiment scores if available.
* Step 5: Building the LSTM Model
* Construct an LSTM neural network using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
* Define the architecture with input layers, LSTM layers (with optional dropout for regularization), and output layers.
* Step 6: Training the LSTM Model
* Train the LSTM model using the training dataset.
* Define the loss function (e.g., mean squared error) and optimizer (e.g., Adam optimizer).
* Feed the training data into the model and adjust the model's weights through backpropagation.
* Step 7: Model Evaluation
* Evaluate the LSTM model's performance using the testing/validation dataset.
* Use metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, or other relevant metrics based on the problem's requirements.
* Step 8: Making Predictions
* Used the trained LSTM model to make predictions on unseen data (future time steps).
* Compared the predicted values with the actual values to assess the model's predictive capability.
* Step 9: Post-Processing
* Visualize the model's predictions alongside the actual stock prices to gain insights into the predicted trends.
* Adjust model parameters or experiment with different architectures to optimize performance.
* Step 10: Deployment and Monitoring
* Deploy the LSTM-based stock trend analysis model as part of a larger application (e.g., web service, mobile app).
* Continuously monitored and updated the model using new data to improve accuracy an
